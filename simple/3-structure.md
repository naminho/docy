# Structure

The documentation is stored inside markdown files.

`Simple`

```
docy
├── 1-intro.md
├── 2-installation.md
├── 3-usage.md
└── 4-license.md
```

Files inside a folder will be ordered alphabetically, to avoid this and keep
the desired order add numbers in front. The filename will only be used for the
purpose of ordering the contents.

`Groups`

```
docy
├── 1-introduction
│   ├── 1-welcome.md
│   └── 2-intro.md
├── 2-installation
|   ├── 1-regular.md
│   └── 2-global.md
├── 3-usage.md
└── 4-license.md
```

For more complex documentations the files can be nested inside folders to
represent different levels.
